# html-fundamentals
This is not a tutorial. As I started learning HTML from "Apna College" I thought that it would be helpful if I can provide the coding part of the tutorial. Most of the part has been explained in the video but as of for my knowledge I have added a comment wherever possible. This makes thing easy to understand for absolute beginners.

If you are a complete beginners and wish to become a "Web Developer" in future then I would recommend you to watch this tutorial provided below. The tutorial also contains Notes and Slides and the Coding part you can easily access from my repo.
